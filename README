Description:
  two commands for publishing highlighted code in HTML or TeX
  (optionally from pandoc as highlighting engine from filter vimhl.hs)

  github: http://github.com/lyokha/vim-publish-helper

Usage:
  The commands may be used from within vim. Additionally they can act as
  the highlighting engine from pandoc having been inserted inside filter
  vimhl.hs shipped with this distribution.

  Command :MakeHtmlCodeHighlight to create a new buffer in a new window with
  HTML code correctly highlighted accordingly to the current color scheme or
  scheme declared in variable g:PhColorscheme. The command uses TOhtml
  internally with temporarily set value g:html_use_css = 0

  Command :MakeTexCodeHighlight to create a new buffer in a new window with
  TeX code correctly highlighted accordingly to the current color scheme or
  scheme declared in variable g:PhColorscheme. The command accepts optional
  argument which defines that lines will be enumerated. If the argument is
  missing then no line enumeration will be generated, if it is negative then
  lines will be enumerated from the number of the first line in the original
  buffer, otherwise lines will be enumerated from the value of the argument.

  The both commands can act as the highlighting engine in filter vimhl.hs
  shipped with this distribution. This program is supposed to be used like

  pandoc -f html -t latex -F vimhl.hs -o document.tex document.html

  It is possible to compile vimhl.hs:

  ghc --make vimhl

  Move vimhl.hs (or compiled program vimhl) somewhere in your $PATH.

  When converting formats with pandoc ensure that original file has
  additional parameter hl="vim" inside tag <pre> (as an example for HTML):
  only in this case pandoc will choose vimhl.hs as highlighting filter.

  There are two other commands :GetFgColorUnderCursor and
  :GetBgColorUnderCursor. They are included as they may help in debugging
  and finding foreground or background colors under cursor. Normally i use
  them in maps like following:

  nmap <silent> ,vc :GetFgColorUnderCursor<CR>
  nmap <silent> ,vb :GetBgColorUnderCursor<CR>
